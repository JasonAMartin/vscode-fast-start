# FAST START

#### Setting up a great VSC environment to get coding now.

This extension pack contains a lot of great extensions that I use often.

I love **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** and am always telling people about it.

The pain point for them seemed to be installing extensions (knowing what to install, setting up, etc). I wanted a way to share my own dev enviornment to help them get going instantly to remove the friction.

Languages I generally code with when using VSC:

- JavaScript + framework roulette (and Node/etc)
- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- LUA
- Elixir
- C# / Unity3D (game development)

### Some cool things to do with this pack:

- Use the project manager to organize your projects (shift+cmd and start typing "project" for more)
- Enjoy knowing when your code is getting out of control thanks to vscode-codemetrics.
- Get quick GIT info on each line thanks to Git Lens.
- Have a fast way to execute NPM scripts via a panel thanks to npm-script.
- Various intellisense and language packs to make working with the languages much better than the default experience.
- Nice highlighting for TODO: and FIXME: notes.
- Get import cost info for your JS files and find heavy imports thanks to import-cost.
- and more!

## Recommended User Settings

Here's the user settings I'm currently using. This is off a Mac, so if you're on Linux (woot) or Windows, change the editor.fontFamily to something appropriate.

```
{
    "editor.fontFamily": "Monaco",
    "editor.fontSize": 14,
    "editor.rulers": [150],
    "editor.tabSize": 2,
    "editor.cursorStyle": "block",
    "editor.formatOnPaste": true,
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
    "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
    "workbench.iconTheme": "material-icon-theme",
    "codemetrics.basics.CodeLensHiddenUnder": 5,
    "csharp.format.enable": false,
    "workbench.colorTheme": "eppz!",
    "codemetrics.basics.ComplexityLevelExtremeDescription": "Most fail, this one has.",
    "codemetrics.basics.ComplexityLevelHighDescription": "This one has failed ...",
    "codemetrics.basics.ComplexityLevelNormalDescription": "Starting to fail.",
    "codemetrics.basics.ComplexityLevelLowDescription": "Readable...",
    "codemetrics.basics.ComplexityLevelNormal": 8,
    "codemetrics.basics.ComplexityLevelHigh": 12,
    "material-icon-theme.showUpdateMessage": false,
    "vsicons.dontShowNewVersionMessage": true,
    "telemetry.enableTelemetry": false,
    "npm.enableScriptExplorer": true,
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
