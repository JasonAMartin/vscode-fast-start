# FAST START
#### Setting up a great VSC environment to get coding now.


This extension pack contains a lot of great extensions that I use often.

Languages I code with:

* JavaScript + framework roulette
* PHP
* Python
* Ruby
* LUA
* Elixir

### Some cool things to do with this pack:

* Use the project manager to organize your projects (shift+cmd and start typing "project" for more)
* Enjoy knowing when your code is getting out of control thanks to vscode-codemetrics.
* Get quick GIT info on each line thanks to Git Lens.
* Have a fast way to execute NPM scripts via a panel thanks to npm-script.
* Various intellisense and language packs to make working with the languages much better than the default experience.
* Nice highlighting for TODO: and FIXME: notes.
* Get import cost info for your JS files and find heavy imports thanks to import-cost.
* and more!
